It also explains why you are in your present position whether you’re earning $6000 a year or $16,000 or $60,000 or $600,000. It applies to every adult whether he’s employed or unemployed. It applies to the richest man and to the poorest and every person in between. And here it is: Our rewards in my life will always be in exact proportion to our contribution, our service.</p>\n<p>If you want it in another form, here it is as it applies to a man’s job. It’s the same thing really, the same thing applies but you can express it differently. The money you’re paid by the company you work for will always be in direct ratio to the need for what you do, your ability to do it and the degree of difficulty involved in replacing you.</p>\n<p>Write the forumla above down, and think about them constantly.</p>\n<p>With the formula, there are two rules which must be applied to properly use it. This formula together with the two rules is your recipe or your roadmap to earning all the money you really want.</p>\n<p>Put this checklist on your mirror, so you can see it every morning.</p>\n<h2>Checklist Item #1: Gold Mine</h2>\n<p>The key to every human being’s success lies in his mind. The gold mine between his ears, one idea can make you rich. Think deliberately and with the purpose. Use the goldmine between your ears. Begin by thinking of a special time every day.</p>\n<h3>Exercise</h3>\n<p>Here’s the best way I have found to make yourself think. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Start getting up a little earlier than you’re accustomed to.\nRight off the bed, this gives you extra time that 95% of the men in this country are not using at all. One hour earlier a day gives you six-and-a half extra 40-hour weeks a year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take a refreshing shower, get yourself ready for the day, sit down to a hot cup of coffee and get yourself a clean sheet of paper</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At the top of the paper, write your financial goal. Now this is the amount of money per year you intend to earn soon\nThink about your goal and what will it mean to you and your family. Then see how many ideas you can come up with to help you reach that goal. Ideas to improve what you now do for a living. Ways of increasing your contribution to match your income goal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Try for five ideas every morning and write them down and stay with those sheets of paper in a special idea file\nMany, perhaps most of your ideas will be worthless but some of them will be very good. A few will be excellent and every once in a while you’ll come up with something really outstanding.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You see five ideas a day is 25 a week if you don’t think on weekends. Now that’s more than a thousand ideas a year. One idea can get you to that income you’re shooting for. The law of averages rings so far in your favor you just can’t miss. Try to develop a sense of expectancy, that is trying to hold the feeling that the goal you’re shooting for is a sure thing. And it is only a matter of time before it’s realized.</p>\n<h2>Checklist Item #2: Attitude</h2>\n<p>Attitude has been called the most important word in the language. William James put it this way, he said, “The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind”</p>\n<h3>Exercise</h3>\n<p>Here is how to change your attitude. Beginning now, begin to act as would the person you most want to become. That is, if you were already in possession of the goal you’re shooting for, how would you conduct yourself in all of your affairs? Well do it now and tomorrow and the next day.</p>\n<p>Do this for 30 days straight until you\'ve become and act like the person you wanted to become like. Then keep going.</p>\n<p>Subtly in little ways, try changing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the way you dress</li>\n<li>in the way you talk and the unfailing courtesy you show to every person with whom you come in contact, begin to act the part of the person who has already achieved that which you’re shooting for.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The German philosopher Goethe gave us the secret when he said, "Before you can do something, you must first be something." When you behave like the person you most want to become, the things that person would have will tend to come to you. It’s simply cause and effect. Don’t be in too big a hurry. It takes longer to build a skyscraper than a chicken coop. Build slowly, steadily and well. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Three things to remember. Three things to practice every day. If you spend 16 hours a day, seven days a week practicing your golf swing, in a relatively short time you’d ever grew beautiful swing like the pros. So practice your new attitude every day, every waking hour. Practice thinking a few minutes every morning and you’ll find yourself thinking all day long.</p>\n<p>Remember the formula: Our rewards in life will always be in exact proportion to our contribution, our service. Go with the ideas in this message every day until it’s as much a part of you as your name and your temporary address. You will notice that each time you listen, you’ll hear something new. You will get a new idea you failed to get before.</p>\n<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tbHYvH347A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<p><a href="https://singjupost.com/19-minutes-that-can-change-your-life-by-earl-nightingale-full-transcript/2/">Original Transcript</a></p>',frontmatter:{title:"19 Minutes That Can Change your Life"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/2017-07-28-earl-nightingale-forumula/"}}}});
